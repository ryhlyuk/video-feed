This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run it properly run one by one:
1) yarn `start:server`
2) yarn `start:frontend`
3) open in your browser `localhost:3000`
4) Links to navigate to playbuzz are available only for the playbuzz videos

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start:server`

Launch server on localhost:5000. (Only one endpoint is available - /assets)

### `yarn start:frontend`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
